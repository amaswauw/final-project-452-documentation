    <h2>
      <li>Setting up the environment</li>
    </h2>
    The first step to setting up the environment is picking out a few images that you would like to use for the
    projectile and trail renderables. Once you have those selected, then you can use the texture engine to load them in.
    This can be accomplished by doing the following:<br>
    <img src="assets/bg.png" alt="Background Image" width="500" height="auto"><br>
    The picture above is of the background that we will be using throughout the project. For simplicity, we will be
    calling the file that we are storing this in <strong>background.png</strong>, and the variable associated with it
    <strong>kBackground</strong>, such that
    <blockquote><strong>this.kBackground = “assets/background.png”;</strong> // Save all your images in the assets
      folder associated with your project.</blockquote>
    <img src="assets/bullet_trail.png" alt="Projectile Trail"><br>
    This picture above is of the projectile's trail that we will be using throughout the project. For simplicity, we
    will be calling the file that we are storing this in <strong>trail.png</strong>, and the variable associated with it
    <strong>kTrail</strong>, such that
    <blockquote><strong>this.kTrail = “assets/trail.png”;</strong></blockquote>
    <img src="assets/second_beam.png" alt="Bullet Projectile"><br>
    This picture above is of the projectile's trail that we will be using throughout the project. For simplicity, we
    will be calling the file that we are storing this in <strong>bullet-projectile.png</strong>, and the variable
    associated with it <strong>kBullet</strong>, such that
    <blockquote><strong>this.kBullet = “assets/bullet-projectile.png”;</strong></blockquote>
    <img src="assets/Terra_Blade_Beam.png" alt="Sword Projectile"><br>
    This picture above is of the projectile's trail that we will be using throughout the project. For simplicity, we
    will be calling the file that we are storing this in <strong>sword-projectile.png</strong>, and the variable
    associated with it <strong>kSword</strong>, such that
    <blockquote><strong>this.kSword = “assets/sword-projectile.png”;</strong></blockquote>
    <h2>
      <li>Loading textures</li>
    </h2>
    Once you have found the pictures that you are going to use throughout the project, the next step that must be done
    is the loading of the images. This can be done with the following lines of code inside of the draw function in
    <b><i>my_game.js</i></b>.
    <blockquote><strong>
        engine.texture.load(this.kBackground);<br>
        engine.texture.load(this.kTrail);<br>
        engine.texture.load(this.kBullet);<br>
        engine.texture.load(this.kSword);
      </strong></blockquote>
    <i>NOTE: To call the functions above, you must have also imported engine from “../engine/index.js”. This should be
      done automatically, but in case it is not, please write at the top of the file (underneath the “use strict”;) the
      following line of code:</i>
    <blockquote><b>import engine from “../engine/index.js”;</b></blockquote>
    <h2>
      <li>Initializing the Projectile Object</li>
    </h2>
    There are many different variations of the projectile constructor (as we have allowed for ones with and without
    trails). This tutorial will go through setting up both projectiles with and without trails. <br>
    In either case, you will need to import the Projectile class. This can be done with the following line of code:
    <blockquote><strong>import Projectile from "../engine/game_objects/projectile.js"</strong></blockquote>
    <ol type="a">
      <h3>
        <li>Projectiles with Trails</li>
      </h3>
      Assuming everything has loaded correctly and you have been keeping up with the tutorial to this point, you can
      initialize the Projectile object with the following line of code:
      <blockquote><strong>this.mProjectile = new Projectile(this.kBullet, Infinity, this.kTrail, 500, 10);</strong>
      </blockquote>
      As a reminder, the first parameter represents the projectile's renderable (which we defined earlier - in step 1),
      the second parameter represents the projectile's lifetime (in the example, we set it to be Infinity, but you can
      change it for how long you would like it to be), the third parameter represents the projectile's trail renderable
      (which we defined earlier - in step 1), the fourth parameter represents the projectile's trail's lifetime (in the
      example we set it to 500 milliseconds but you can change it for how long you would like it to be), and the final
      parameter is the trail interval, which is the duration (in milliseconds) between each trail's creation (we have
      set it to be 10 milliseconds but you can set it how you would like it to be).<br><br>
      This will in turn create a projectile object with the trail renderable!
      <h3>
        <li>Projectiles without Trails</li>
      </h3>
      The projectiles without trails are very similar to the projectiles with trails. The only thing that is different
      is the fact that the constructor takes in less parameters. The new method call would look like this:
      <blockquote><strong>this.mProjectile = new Projectile(this.kBullet, Infinity);</strong></blockquote>
      As a reminder, the first parameter represents the projectile's renderable (which we defined earlier - in step 1),
      the second parameter represents the projectile's lifetime (in the example, we set it to be Infinity, but you can
      change it for how long you would like it to be).
    </ol>
    <h2>
      <li>Setting the Projectile's Path Type</li>
    </h2>
    Our projectile class currently supports 3 different types of Projectile path types, straight, tracking, and
    parabolic. This section will walk through how to set each one up in detail.
    <ol type="a">
      <h3>
        <li>Straight Projectile Path Type</li>
      </h3>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      <li>Final Steps</li>
    </h2>
    As the final steps of the projectile creation process, all that is left to do is draw and update the projectile
    inside of <b><i>my_game.js</i></b>. This will be done in the <strong>draw()</strong> and <strong>update()</strong>
    methods, respectively.
    <ol type="a">
      <h3>
        <li>Drawing Projectile</li>
      </h3>
      To draw the projectile, please use the write the following lines of code within <b><i>my_game.js</i></b> in the
      <b>draw()</b> function:
      <blockquote><strong>this.mProjectile.draw();</strong></blockquote>
      <h3>
        <li>Updating Projectile</li>
      </h3>
      To update the projectile, please use the write the following lines of code within <b><i>my_game.js</i></b> in the
      <b>update()</b> function:
      <blockquote><strong>this.mProjectile.update();</strong></blockquote>
    </ol>
  </ol>
